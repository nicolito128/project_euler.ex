> [!WARNING]
> This repository has the sole purpose of serving as a personal archive of my solutions to the first 100 [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) problems in the Elixir programming language.

> If you have not yet managed to get any answers or implementations on your own, I recommend that you do not look at this source code.
